This has shadowed many other existing diseases. In this blog post, I will use mortality data from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/causes-of-death) to look at the main diseases that impact the population.\n\n\n## Data description\n\nThe mortality data set contains information about the causes of death. The variables that will be used in this blog are the following:\n\n-   Entity: This contains country name, continent, and different income level\n\n-   Code: The country code stored in the ISO3 format\n\n-   Year: Time period from 1990 - 2019\n\n-   Causes of deaths: The mortality rate for each cause of deaths type (21 diseases types, 11 other types)\n\nFor the cause of death data, I will only use the disease information, and other causes of death that are not related to diseases will not be used. Also, the **Entity** variable will only contain the country name. The continent and different income levels will be removed. \n\nTo ensure that the data can be visualized using the map, the map data set obtained from [opendatasoft](https://public.opendatasoft.com/explore/dataset/world-administrative-boundaries/export/) has been included. The *read_sf* function will be used to read the shapefile data. I will only be using the following variable:\n\n-   iso3: The ISO 3 territory code\n\n-   continent: The continent of the territory\n\n-   geometry: sf object contains the boundary for each territory\n\nThe following alteration has been implemented:\n\n-   Using the *select* function, only the causes of deaths that are health-related are selected\n\n-   Using the *filter* function, filtered the **Entity** to only contain the countries (removing other entities, e.g., world bank lower income)\n\n-   Using the *right_join* function to join the mortality data set and world map together\n\n-   Using the *pivot_longer* function to put all the causes of death variables into one column called **Disease** and the mortality rate into the column called **Mortality_rate_(%)**\n\n\n## Highest cause of death in each country\n\n@fig-worldmap shows that the disease that causes most death is Cardiovascular disease, as the deepest red color represents the highest number of countries that are affected by the disease. The second disease that causes the most death is Neoplasms (also known as cancer).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Highest cause of death in each country](disease_files/figure-html/fig-worldmap-1.png){#fig-worldmap width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nFrom @fig-worldmap, I have found some interesting points. Cardiovascular diseases highly affected most countries in the world. However, Australia and countries in Africa are affected by other diseases, such as neoplasms and HIV/AIDS. It is because the income level in Africa is low, which means less access to a good education leads to less information about communicable diseases like HIV/AIDS. In Australia, an increase in mortality rate from neoplasms are due to the growth in size and aging of the Australian population (\"Cancer burden and control in Australia: lessons learnt and challenges remaining\", 2018).\n\n\n## Top 10 higest mortality rate in the world for 2019\n\nThere are two main types of disease, Non-communicable and Communicable diseases. Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) it is a disease that can not be passed on from person to person, while communicable diseases can spread from person to person. Now let’s see the types of diseases in 2019 that are the most deadly in the world.\n\n<div>\n\n<a name = 'top10'></a>\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<table class=\"table table-striped table-hover\" style=\"width: auto !important; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n<caption>Top 10 highest mortality rate in the world for 2019</caption>\n <thead>\n  <tr>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Rank </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Disease </th>\n  </tr>\n </thead>\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 1. </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Cardiovascular diseases </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 2. </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Neoplasms </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 3. </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Lower respiratory infections </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 4. </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Digestive diseases </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 5. </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Chronic respiratory diseases </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 6. </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Diabetes mellitus </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 7. </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Neonatal disorders </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 8. </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Chronic kidney disease </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 9. </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Alzheimer's disease and other dementias </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 10. </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Cirrhosis and other chronic liver diseases </td>\n  </tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n`````\n:::\n:::\n\n\n</div>\n\nFrom the [top-10 table](#top10), there are seven diseases that are NCD. Cardiovascular diseases, Neoplasms, Chronic respiratory diseases, Diabetes mellitus, Chronic kidney disease, Alzheimer's disease, Cirrhosis, and other chronic liver diseases. While the two diseases, Lower respiratory infections and Neonatal disorders classified as Communicable diseases. Digestive diseases can be both NCD and CD.\n\nAs there are up to seven out of ten NCDs in this global list, it shows that the impact of NCDs is larger than how it is currently portrayed in society nowadays. This implies that people should be more aware of the consequences that come from these diseases. Also, from medical professionals' perspective, investment in more effective treatment should be made one of the main priorities. \n\n\n## Impact of NCD over time\n\nTo further analyze the impact of NCD, I will plot the time series for each disease and see how it impacts over time.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Impact of NCD over time](disease_files/figure-html/fig-NCD-1.png){#fig-NCD width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nFrom @fig-NCD the trend of the mortality rate seems to increase over time, which is very concerning as this shows that there is not enough effort put into developing the treatment needed for these diseases. \n\nAs media continues to shift focus to the new communicable diseases like COVID-19 and Monkey Pox, it is still vital for people around the world to recognize how deadly some common diseases can be. For the global population, having access to accurate and educational information about these diseases is important as it will allow people to look out for the symptoms and protect themselves effectively. On the other hand, from the medical point of view, as earlier mentioned before, there should be more resources such as more accessibility to treatment and medicines for these diseases. The implementation of these recommendations can potentially be beneficial for not only medical professionals but for many populations around the world as well.\n\n\n## References\n\nCheng, E.
